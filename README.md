# tda-portfolio
A cli portfolio viewer using the very convenient [tda api](https://github.com/alexgolec/tda-api).

I spend most of my day in a terminal window, and having to switch to a browser, slogging through the login process, etc, is not particularly convenient if you just want a quick glance at your positions. If you're a TD Ameritrade customer, and also like working at the command line, this is for you.

In order to use this, you'll need to follow the instructions at the github link above to authenticate with oauth.

Once done, you need to fill in the 'token path' and the 'api key' vars in the config file example, and save it as config.ini. Do not quote the path/api keys.
